1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery ensures cost control, client satisfaction, and competitive advantage. Project managers can meet deadlines through effective planning, risk management, agile methodologies, and continuous progress monitoring.

2.	Cost Control and Budget Overruns
Effective cost control prevents financial losses and ensures resource efficiency. Strategies include detailed budgeting, regular financial tracking, scope management, and risk mitigation.

3.	Agile vs. Waterfall
•	Agile: Iterative, flexible, allows for continuous feedback, but can lead to scope creep.
•	Waterfall: Structured, clear documentation, better for fixed-scope projects but lacks adaptability to changing requirements.
4.	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
•	Agile: Suitable for evolving projects like software startups or mobile apps.
•	Waterfall: Best for well-defined projects like banking systems or government software.

5.	Quality Assurance Methods
Continuous testing, automated testing, peer code reviews, and user feedback loops ensure high software quality, reducing defects and improving reliability.

6.	Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 
Defining scope prevents scope creep and ensures project alignment. WBS breaks tasks into manageable units, improving planning, tracking, and delegation.

7.	Project Schedule & Gantt Charts
A detailed schedule ensures proper resource allocation and task sequencing. Gantt charts visualize timelines, dependencies, and progress.

8.	Core Issues Addressed by Software
Software should solve a clear problem, such as inefficiencies, lack of automation, or communication gaps, improving productivity and user experience.

9.	Importance of Clearly Defining the Problem
A well-defined problem statement ensures targeted development, better user satisfaction, and more efficient resource utilization.

10.	How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
A non-technical description should focus on user benefits, e.g., “An AI-powered scheduling tool that automates task assignments for teams.”

11.	What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Unique functionalities like AI automation, seamless integrations, real-time collaboration, or enhanced security can differentiate a product.

12.	What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Researching market reports, competitor analysis, and customer demand trends helps gauge potential profitability and expansion opportunities.

13.	How can understanding market trends inform your software positioning and development?
Understanding trends like AI, cloud computing, or remote work adoption helps refine features, target audience, and marketing strategies effectively
